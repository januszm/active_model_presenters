# ActiveModelPresenters

This gem adds `Presenter` pattern to ActiveModel/Record models. The idea is that each model in the application is enhanced with a `p` or `present(er)` method that returns a SimpleDelegator backed object which enhances the original model. TL;DR it is meant to solve simple problem, seamlessly: when you generate a new model, you get a new presenter class that by default does nothing. But when you reach a point when you start adding methods to your model, that look like 'formatted_created_at' or 'full_name' or 'to_something...' it's the moment when you should move this code to the presenter class. Wtih the help of this gem, you should get a dedicated presenter class each time you generate a new model.
